# Soybean-Agriculture
ML-Based Project.
# About the Dataset: -
Some plants grow better in certain conditions, like when they get the right amount of water, sunlight, and nutrients. Scientists collect information about plants to understand what helps them grow best. This collection of information is called a dataset.
The "Advanced Soybean Agricultural Dataset" is a special collection of information about soybean plants. It was created in 2025 by smart researchers at the College of Agriculture, University of Tikrit. These researchers wanted to help farmers grow better crops and improve food production.
# Purpose of Analysis: -
The main aim of analysis is to make a prediction model that how well the soybean plant grow in different conditions. Weâ€™ll create a simple prediction model using Linear regression.
# Dataset Overview: -
The dataset comprises 15 rows and 55450 columns, each row represents one soybean plant, and each column tells us something important like: - 
How tall the plant is
How many pods (seed holders) it has
How much it weighs
How much chlorophyll it has (chlorophyll helps plants make food)
How much protein is in the seeds
How much water is inside the leaves
How many seeds the plant produces
